# Global Dengue Situation Dashboard  

We plan to establish a climate-driven real-time global outbreak forecasting system for dengue by combining databases, modelling approaches, and leveraging the expertise of the dengue modelling and mapping group at LSHTM. 

Establishing the observatory will require creating a new real-time database of dengue case data for over 50 countries to ensure we always have up-to-date data, developing flexible Bayesian forecasting models to make nowcasts and forecasts of outbreaks up to three months ahead and effectively communicating outbreak warnings at the national and regional level to trigger additional mosquito control to prevent epidemics. 

Extension of our predictions to non-endemic areas in Europe and North America will localise the increasing threat climate change poses to mosquito-transmitted disease risk in these areas. Collaboration with individuals at the World Health Organization will extent the observatory’s reach and allow outbreak forecasts to reach the country decision makers necessary to act early and save lives.

The project has three main objectives:

- Objective 1: Developing a global dengue database
- Objective 2: Training and testing nowcast and forecast models
- Objective 3: Issuing alerts and evaluating responses
