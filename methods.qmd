*Real-Time Data Collection* 

We retrieve near real-time dengue case data for each country from multiple WHO
global and regional dashboards: the WHO Global Dengue Surveillance Dashboard
(https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/dengue_global/), the WHO South-East Asia
Region Dengue Dashboard (https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/searo-dengue-
dashboard/#), and the Pan American Health Organization PLISA database
(https://www.paho.org/en/arbo-portal/dengue-data-and-analysis/dengue-analysis-
country). Automated data scraping tools visit each dashboard daily, checking whether
new updates are available since the last download and store the data in a structured
format in the corresponding data repository. The scraping tools for each dashboard
along with all downloaded data are publicly available here:
WHO Global Dengue Surveillance Dashboard:
https://github.com/DengueGlobalObservatory/WHOGlobal-crawler
WHO South-East Asia Region Dengue Dashboard:
https://github.com/DengueGlobalObservatory/SEARO-crawler
PAHO PLISA: https://github.com/DengueGlobalObservatory/PAHO-crawler

Data from the regional (PAHO, SEARO) and global (WHO) databases are combine to create a single current year dataframe. For countries included in both the regional and global database the regional database is prioritised. 


*Historical Data*


Our predictions are based on the OpenDengue project, which compiles dengue case
data reported by national health authorities, international organisations such as the
World Health Organization, and literature. This global database provides a long-term
view of dengue patterns across many regions and years. To ensure full coverage and
consistency, we use a version of the OpenDengue data that fills in missing months and
adjusts gaps in reported data using statistical models that estimate monthly dengue
cases for 143 countries from 1990 to 2024 based on typical seasonal patterns
(https://github.com/ahyoung-lim/OD_gap_filling_public). These harmonized data form
the foundation of our real-time forecasting system, allowing us to X, Y, and Z.

*Estimating the reporting factor of American Nations*

For American nations, the estimates of reporting factors were calculated
empirically from the PAHO DENV cases dashboard [PLISA Health Information
Platform for the
Americas](https://www3.paho.org/data/index.php/en/mnu-topics/indicadores-dengue-en/dengue-nacional-en/252-dengue-pais-ano-en.html).
From June 2022 to February 2023 the PAHO DENV cases dashboard was
downloaded weekly. Additionally the DENV case data for the same time
period was downloaded from the PAHO DENV cases dashboard in July 2024.
Using this data the reporting factor for each country at each lag in
data reporting could be estimated using the following equation:

$$\mathbf{f}_{c,d} = (\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=i}^{T} \left( \frac{N_{t,c,d}}{V_{t,c}} \right))/1$$
where N is the number of DENV cases for a given country (c), at a given
epiweek (t) for a given delay (d), V is the validated count of DENV
cases for a given country (c), at a given epiweek (t) and f is the
reporting factor for a given country (c), at a given epiweek (t) for a
given delay (d). T is the number of observation recorded.

*Correcting DENV cases*

For all nations the most recent update was considered to be the most
accurate data for the monthly counts of DENV cases. For PAHO nations
this case count was multiplied by the average reporting factor at
corresponding delay and country. Four nations (Belize, Dominica,
Barbados and Paraguay) did not undergo this correct due to the complex
nature of reporting factors in those countries. This corrections
resulted in small differences in the monthly and overall cause count.

::: {.card title="Defining the Dengue Season"}

The temporal distribution of dengue counts can be considered with reference to different temporal
periods. Calendar year represents the natural period for consideration. Here we define another period,
termed the ‘dengue season’. This is characterized as lasting 12 months starting from the month with
lowest average case counts. For example, if April is the calendar month with lowest case load on
average, it becomes the first month of the season, and March the last month.
Using this alternative temporal window aids assessment of the average dengue season, by addressing
instances where the peak months lie across the new year. In these instances, if analysis were
performed by calendar year, small changes in timing of the peak months could lead to significant
changes in the number of cases allocated to each year, potentially skewing results. Aligning data from
calendar year to dengue season accounts for this by defining a temporal window with no risk of the
peak months overlapping consecutive seasons.

::: {.card title="Nowcasting"}

Using the season aligned data we define an average seasonal profile. First, monthly data is
normalised, by dividing the number of cases observed in each month by the total across the entire
season. This normalisation rescales the data to exist between 0 and 1.

$$
\text{Monthly proportion of cases} = \frac{\text{Monthly cases}}{\text{Total season cases}}
$$
Once normalised, the average season is defined by calculating the average proportion of cases
observed within each month. This average season has power for filling data gaps. The total number of
cases expected for that season can be calculated by combining the number of cases observed so far
with the proportion expected.

$$
\text{Expected total seasonal cases} = \frac{\text{Cases observed to date}}{\text{Expected proportion to date}}
$$

Once the total number of cases expected for that season has been calculated, the monthly proportions
of the average seasonal profile can be used to calculate expected cases for months lacking data so far.

$$
\text{Predicted monthly cases} = \text{Expected total seasonal cases} \times \text{Monthly proportion}
$$

This method is here used for nowcasting, the process of filling missing data gaps to date.
