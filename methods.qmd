*Estimating the reporting factor of American Nations*

For American nations, the estimates of reporting factors were calculated
empirically from the PAHO DENV cases dashboard [PLISA Health Information
Platform for the
Americas](https://www3.paho.org/data/index.php/en/mnu-topics/indicadores-dengue-en/dengue-nacional-en/252-dengue-pais-ano-en.html).
From June 2022 to February 2023 the PAHO DENV cases dashboard was
downloaded weekly. Additionally the DENV case data for the same time
period was downloaded from the PAHO DENV cases dashboard in July 2024.
Using this data the reporting factor for each country at each lag in
data reporting could be estimated using the following equation:

$$\mathbf{f}_{c,d} = (\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=i}^{T} \left( \frac{N_{t,c,d}}{V_{t,c}} \right))/1$$
where N is the number of DENV cases for a given country (c), at a given
epiweek (t) for a given delay (d), V is the validated count of DENV
cases for a given country (c), at a given epiweek (t) and f is the
reporting factor for a given country (c), at a given epiweek (t) for a
given delay (d). T is the number of observation recorded.

*Correcting DENV cases*

For all nations the most recent update was considered to be the most
accurate data for the monthly counts of DENV cases. For PAHO nations
this case count was multiplied by the average reporting factor at
corresponding delay and country. Four nations (Belize, Dominica,
Barbados and Paraguay) did not undergo this correct due to the complex
nature of reporting factors in those countries. This corrections
resulted in small differences in the monthly and overall cause count.

*Forecasting using average monthly proportions*

Understanding this underlying seasonal profile can provide a basis for
predicting future case load, using observations of the number of cases
observed to date within a given season. Dividing cumulative cases
observed within a given season by the expected cumulative proportion
returns an estimate of the total number of cases expected for that
season. Multiplying this figure by expected monthly proportion returns
an estimate of monthly cases. Fig. 2 uses data from Thailand and Fiji,
locations with 32 and 3 seasons of data respectively, to demonstrate
this use case. Here existing seasonal profiles are used to predict the
most recent season with data available. Predicted and observed values
are closer together for Thailand than Fiji, highlighting the increased
predictive power provided by increasing the number of seasons used for
prediction.

::: {.card title="Defining the Dengue Season"}
*Identifying dengue season*

Using combined data from the OpenDengue and WHO dengue observatories we
identify the calendar month with the lowest case load on average. We
define this month as the first month of the dengue season. By example,
if April is the calendar month with lowest case load on average, it
becomes the first month of the season, and March the last month. This
process normalises the seasonal profiles across different locations by
setting a unified starting point. It also addresses instances where the
peak season lies across the new year. Were analysis performed by
calendar year, small changes in the timing of the season peak could lead
to significant changes in the number of cases allocated to each year.
Aligning data from calendar year to season accounts for such potential
peak timing heterogeneity across years, which could skew results.

Once data has been aligned from calendar year to dengue season any
locations with less than three seasons of data were removed. Monthly
proportion of cases observed within each season was then calculated,
normalising for between-season differences in total case load. Taking
the average of this proportion across all seasons provides a baseline
seasonal profile for each country. Standard deviation of this proportion
provides a measure of uncertainty around this average proportion,
accounting for between year differences in case load distribution.
Figure 1 shows the average cumulative monthly proportion by country,
with error bars representing the 95% confidence intervals.
